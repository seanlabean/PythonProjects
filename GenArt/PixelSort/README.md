# PixelSort

This repo is flowering out of a rapidly acquired interest in procedural art in large part thanks to [100 Rabbits](100r.co). Though in particular, [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HMmmBDRy-jE&list=LL&index=1&t=3s&ab_channel=Acerola) by Acerola illustrated to me how (relatively) simple procedural art can be. As simple as clever pixel manipulation.

This is a living repo as always, and all contents are free to use by all.
