# Tinkerbell Map

The [Tinkerbell Map](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinkerbell_map) is a class of chaotic dynamical system known as an attractor in which the system tends to evolove to a state or set of states.

The Tinkerbell attractor can be described by:

$$x_{n+1}=x_{n}^{2}-y_{n}^{2}+ax_{n}+by_{n}$$

$$y_{n+1}=2x_{n}y_{n}+cx_{n}+dy_{n}$$

Because system values that approach the attractor values remain close even if slightly disturbed, we can progressively vary parameters of the Tinkerbell system to create the illusion of motion/evolution.

This particular Tinkerbell system is described by the parameters: `x_0 = -0.72; y_0 = -0.64; a = 0.90; b = -0.6013; c = 2.0; d = 0.50`
