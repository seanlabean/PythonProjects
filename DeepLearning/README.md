This is my personal workspace as I walk through the chapters of
'Deep Learning From Scratch' by Seth Weidman published by O'Reilly Media.

As stated in the text's Preface (xii) use and distribution of coding
elements from the text is allowed and does not require permission.

Chapter 01: Foundations
	* Basic visualizations and code applications of simple functions,
	derivatives, multi-variable functions, and vector functions.
	

Chapter 02: Fundamentals
	* Overviews of Supervised Learning, Linear Regression, Model Design,
	basic Neural Nets.

More chapters to be added once I get to them.
