# Amleth

Amleth is a collection of trend gathering and visualization tools broadly related to finance and economic activity. The core of Amleth lies in the NLP of text data from company 10-K or 13-F filings to extract potential trends from changes in company risk strategies or investment portfolios.

Amleth also extracts trends from geo-positional data whether from more simple examples like movement of commuters through NYC or more nuanced insatnces like determining the extent of home bias in investment fund holdings.

The act of creating Amleth has served as an effort in learning for myself. Through this creation I've learned:

1. Automated web browsing with `selenium`
2. Webscraping and data processing
3. Natural language processing
4. Processing geographical data with GIS tools like `folium`
5. Data frame manipulation with `pandas`

I am actively expanding Amleth to be a stand alone source of trend forcasting modules. At the moment, I am developing the tool souly within Jupyter Notebooks, my preferred mode of coding Python.

Stay tuned for more updates.
